The astute environment takes a FITS cube (or a related set)
and for each FITS cube it creates a matching directory
in which you can find:


- im/	     	   CASA image  (right now .)
- PV/		   CASA image representing a selected PV slice
- cubestats.tab    ASCII table respresenting useful cube stats, 
                   one per plane. Right now ccdstat.tab and imstat.tab
- slines.list      output from slsearch()
- mlines.list      matched molecules from slines.list (or some other process)
- L_mol/           CASA image cube for each "mol" listed in mlines.list
- L_mol/MOM0/      CASA mom0 image from the cube
