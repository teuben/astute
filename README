The name....  ASTUTE was really hyjacked from another effort, and it stuck.
for while. What you see in this project "astute" is the old-style pipeline,
based on MIS and easily allowing foreign packages to be used (MIRIAD, 
NEMO). The new style ADMIT will be more restricted a designed from the
ground up.  Experimental things will go into this package, ASTUTE.

Now that it's proposal time (August 16, 2013) we really need a new name.
Here were the options offered, where the first one got the most votes:
(and notice Leslie, whe compiled this list, managed to give ASTUTE a few
new meanings)

ADMIT - ALMA Data MIning Toolkit
ASTUTE - ALMA Science Tap Utilizing a Toolkit Extraordinary
ASTUTE - ALMA Science Tap Utilizing Toolkit Examination
DATA - Data Access Toolkit for ALMA
AMINT - ALMA MINing Toolkit 
ADApT - ALMA DAta Toolkit
TADA = Toolkit for ALMA Data Access
TADAA - Toolkit for ALMA Data Archive Access
DMAT - Data Mining for ALMA Toolkit
TADaM  - Toolkit for ALMA DAta Mining
MAD - Mining ALMA Data 
AST - ALMA Science Toolkit 
ADAM - ALMA DAta Mining
ADAMS - ALMA DAta Mining for Science
ADAMaNT - ALMA DAta MiniNg Toolkit

if the VLA is added:
RADMIT  Radio Astronomy Data MIning Toolkit
