ADMIT within ASTUTE:
  this only supports CASA 4.2 and up, due to the nature of the python tree structure
  CASA has adopted   (PYTHONPATH is set to $CASAPATH/lib/python/site-packages during
  easy_install)


A typical install doesn't need ATUTE to be installed, but cvs checked out, viz.

  cvs co astute
  cd astute/admit
  make import			 (we don't edit the appropriate files locally yet)
  make build			 this builds the .egg file
  make dist			 this puts the .egg on a  website for URL retrieval
  make install_local		 easy_install from the local file
  make install_url		 easy_install using our URL

Then use some 
     
  cd astute/data
  ipython
  > import admit.adm
  > reload(admit.adm)
  > a=admit.adm.ADMIT()
  > a.query_dir()

  # get benchmark data
  make bench1

  # do the test
  make test1


distutils:

1)
	easy_install

2)	
	python setup.py install -home=<dir>

	modules  HOME/lib/python
	scripts	 HOME/bin
	data	 HOME
	C-header HOME/include/python/<distname>

3) 	python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local



astropy:

As of version 0.4 we will attempt to align admit with astropy, 
if astropy was not installed with your version of CASA.

Best is to use a distro source code install,untar this within
the casapy-XXX root directory, make sure you have `which python`
from the CASA/.../bin tree, and use the standard
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install
technique from within the astropy source tree.
