ADMIT within ASTUTE:
  this only supports CASA 4.2 and up, due to the nature of the python tree structure
  CASA has adopted   (PYTHONPATH is set to $CASAPATH/lib/python/site-packages during
  easy_install)


A typical install doesn't need ATUTE to be installed, but cvs checked out, viz.

  cvs co astute
  cd astute/admit
  make import			 (we don't edit the appropriate files locally yet)
  make build			 this builds the .egg file
  make dist			 this puts the .egg on a  website for URL retrieval
  make install_local		 easy_install from the local file
  make install_url		 easy_install using our URL

Then use some 
     
  cd astute/data
  ipython
  > import admit.adm
  > reload(admit.adm)
  > a=admit.adm.ADMIT()
  > a.query_dir()

  # get benchmark data
  make bench1

  # do the test
  make test1


distutils:

1)
	easy_install

2)	
	python setup.py install -home=<dir>

	modules  HOME/lib/python
	scripts	 HOME/bin
	data	 HOME
	C-header HOME/include/python/<distname>

3) 	python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local



astropy:

As of version 0.4 we will attempt to align admit with astropy, 
if astropy was not installed with your version of CASA.

Best is to use a distro source code install, untar this within
the casapy-XXX root directory, so you know which one you used
later on (after all, both CASA and ASTROPY change often).
From the casapy prompt and from within the astropy source root,
you can simply use
    casapy --nogui
    !python setup.py build
    !python setup.py install
You will then need to exit from casapy and re-enter for the command
    import astropy 
to work. Don't do this from the astropy source tree root, it is
protected against working there.

There's a flaw with this approach: the install silently assumes
that python and casa's python are the same version, which is actually
a bug in the installation procedure of astropy.

One way to solve this is the approach in  https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/casa-python
The drawback is that only one version of casa can be done this way, others will be able
to live with this version (which may be ok on the short term).  The 'astroload' or
'modules' approach needs to be dealt with a different way. Here's the recipe:
[and please note the creation of ~/.casa/{bin,lib}  : use with caution]

git clone https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/casa-python
cd casa-python
/usr/bin/python setup_casapy_pip.py
   -> this will do a lot of install (needs internet too for pip, setuptools etc.)
   -> tells to add /home/teuben/.casa/bin to your PATH, or really $HOME/.casa/bin
   -> TODO: should have an option to write into the CASA tree, this would enable
            multiple casapy installs
set path = ($HOME/.casa/bin $path); rehash
   -> "casa-python setup.py install"  is now the way how to install packages
   -> "casa-pip" to do it the easy pip way
casa-pip install astropy
