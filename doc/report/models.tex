\section{Intercomparison of Model and Observational Data}

As the study progressed, we felt that this area was of less
importance than continuing to development the XML structure
design for ADMIT. By adopting the CASA and its python environment,
we will be able to adopt python based program for reading output
from modeling programs and simulations into a common format.
During the course of our study, we also learned that CASA was
in the process of evaluating its approach to the python environment.
Changes there could make a wider range of existing programs
easily available for use.
