#! /bin/csh -f
#
#   this peculiar script allows one to write executable
#   python scripts and place them in your $PATH with a top
#   line
#          #! /usr/bin/env casarun
#
#   It really is nothing more than
#          exec casapy --nogui -c $*
#
#   But for convenience a few extra bells and whistles were added:
#
#   When invoked with  -c   if gives the count of the arguments
#   in sys.argv[] that can be ignored if to be converted for
#   classic post-casa argv processing.
#   E.g.
#   argv = admit.casa_argv(sys.argv)
#   argv[0] is now the script name when you did
#  
# @todo  if don't see --nogui, return regular sys.argv?
#        this way it can be used with with and without casa


#echo  CASARUN: $#argv  $*

set casapy=(casapy --nogui -c)

if ($#argv == 0) then
   echo "Usage:  $0 -c"
   echo "        $0 scriptname [ARGS]"
else if ("X$1" == "X-c") then
   echo $#casapy
else
   # do the real work
   exec $casapy $*
endif


#
# The following python code can also be found in the admit module:
#
# def casa_argv(argv):
#     lines = os.popen("casarun -c","r").readlines()
#     n = int(lines[len(lines)-1].strip())
#     return argv[n:]
