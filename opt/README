Here you can place optional external packages that we have played with:

dendro (Beaumont)
      git clone https://github.com/ChrisBeaumont/Dendro dendro-c++

      might need something like
      ln -s /usr/share/automake-1.11/install-sh
      needs CCfits, then some automake version mismatch

dendro-core-cb  (the Harvard version; Beaumont)

      git clone git://github.com/dendrograms/dendro-core.git dendro-core-cb
