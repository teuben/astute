Here you can place optional external packages that we have played with:

dendro (Beaumont)
      git clone https://github.com/ChrisBeaumont/Dendro dendro-c++

      might need something like
      ln -s /usr/share/automake-1.11/install-sh
      needs CCfits, then some automake version mismatch

dendro-core-cb  (the Harvard version; Beaumont)

      git clone git://github.com/dendrograms/dendro-core.git dendro-core-cb

or
      got clone https://github.com/astrofrog/astrodendro	


      WARNING: these are now old, if you install them, it may conflict with
      the now formal astrodendro module (see below)

dendro-core-er  (the Canadian version; Rosolowski)

      git clone https://github.com/low-sky/dendro-core dendro-core-er

astrodendro

      git clone https://github.com/dendrograms/astrodendro.git
      cd astrodendro
      python setup.py install
      	    add --user when not root?
