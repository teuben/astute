This is the place where we collect many example , useful for
ADMIT post processing using modules you may or may not have.

The idea is that you catch the missing modules, or execute
some simple example

We will assuming the basic CASA modules are always present,
i.e. numpy, scipy and matplotplib.


For example


try:
    from astropy.table import Table
except:
    print "no astropy"
    os.exit(0)
