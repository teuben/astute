NGC6334I.fits

    - 800 x 800 x 2404 x 1 
    - 6.0 GB
    - modestly complex structure. several isolated sources, 
      some which are slightly extended, 
      with multiple spectral lines
    - noise about 30 mJy/beam
    - peak value 688 mJy/beam

NGC6334Isub.fits

    - smaller 241 x 226 x 2404
    - 511 MB
    - still contains most of the essential structure,
      most of the blobs are in the north-west region of the map
    - last 10 channels are no good (2395..2404)
