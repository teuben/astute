A super small 4 x 3 x 2 data cube that can be used to test
your reading routine, notably if you're confused about column
and row major data.
Essentially, datavalues are BITPIX=-32 (float or REAL*4) value:
   data = i + 10*j + 100*k     (i=0,1,2,3   j=0,1,2    k=0,1)
and "hexdump -C" gives the following 96 values:
