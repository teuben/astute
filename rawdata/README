this directory is meant to contain symbolic links
to locations on your local system, such that we
can use references such as
	rawdata=$TAS/rawdata/n253
in the tas.def files that make the system more portable
accross machines. Astute knows has to dereference them.
Eg.

	cd $TAS/rawdata
	ln -s /disk0/alma/data/n253



Here are the data repo's at the various institutions:

n253      dante:/mnt/raidvol0/teuben/n253
          astro.umd.edu:/local/ftp/pub/carma/data/astute/n253
