After having obtained this via CVS, e.g.

  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.astro.umd.edu:/home/cvsroot  login              [needed only once]
  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.astro.umd.edu:/home/cvsroot  checkout astute

you should prepare it for your shell:

  cd astute
  ./configure
  source astute_start.csh


0) make sure you have python with astropy, ATpy, asciitable etc. installed.
   see opt/README for optional things you might like to borrow


1) prepare a miriad version of the small benchmark cube (you need MIRIAD for this)

   cd data
   fits in=ros13co.fits out=ros13co.mir op=xyin


2) cd $ASTUTE/lib
   ./clumpfind.py mir    (needs MIRIAD)
   ./clumpfind.py idl    (only runs under GDL now, although known to run in idl)
   ./clumpfind.py den    (you'll need to install dendro-core via $ASTUTE/opt)
